YouTube - Exploratory Data Analysis
PowerBI 
Description: In this project I have analysed the YouTube Videos and Channels Metadata dataset, available on: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/revealing-insights-from-youtube-video-and-channe), to uncover trends and patterns. I have used Power Query for data cleaning.
